      <p><b>Role:</b> Since this is a Case Study I covered all the phases of the project,<br/>
        from mapping out the problem to delivering the final design.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>Duration:</b> 5 weeks.</p>
</div>





<div class='col1'>
<h1>The problem is about the Individual Courses </h1>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li> <b>It is not clear that the company also offers individual courses.</b><br/>
       Because they are not mentioned in the homepage where only the courses to become yoga professionals are advertised.</li>
       <br/>
<li> Furthermore <b>the information about the individual courses is fragmented into various pages</b>
  which prevent from having a clear overview, making the user start and interrupt many flows.</li>
  <br/>
<li> <b>The primary purpose of the company is unclear</b>.<br/>
  All the buttons are primary CTAs which do not guide the user to follow a intentional path.</li>

</ol>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='container'>
  <div class='row align-items-center'>
  <div class='col1'>
    <br/>
    <h2>What is the purpose of the project? </h2>
    <p>Since the company aims to online selling and booking, the goal is to <b>improve the user experience on pages that allow
      the user to join a individual course</b>.<br/>
      So the path from the request of a free trial, to the purchase of a package until the lesson booking on the calendar.</p>

      </div>

      <div class='col'>
        <br/>
      <h2>And why? </h2>
    <p>Make it clear that the company also offers individual courses and facilitate their joining by providing:
       clear information and easy-fast-intuitive purchase and booking paths, <b>allows the company to reach a wider target</b>
       than it can reach by selling training courses (to become yoga professionals) or corporate courses.</p>

</div>
</div>


    <div class='col1'>
   <h1>Discovering the Brand</h1>
   <p>I started by running an overall heuristic evaluation to figure out the issues of the website. <br/>
      I then generated the sitemap as is, followed by an analysis of
      the flows and pages related to individual courses, which is the part on which the project focuses:
     <ul>
       <li> The 2 "Booking a lesson" flows: for the new user (free trial lesson) and for the subscriber user</li>
       <li> "Buy a  subscription" flow </li>
       <li> "Pricing" page</li>
       <li> "Registration" page during the checkout process</li>
  </ul>
</p>

   <h1> Competitor Analysis</h1>
     <p>Bali Yoga is considered one of the best yoga centers in Milan by the press and people;
     evidence is given by many ranking charts available online.<br/>
     The direct competitors are 5 companies operating in Milan:<br/>
     Spazio Garibaldi 77, Casa Yoga, City Zen, Rama Yoga and Nalu Yoga.</p>
     <p>Common elements:
       <ul>
         <li> availability of streaming lessons </li>
          <li> training courses </li>
           <li> online booking </li>
         </ul></p>
        <p> Differences:
           <ul>
             <li>not all of them offer free trials </li>
              <li> some of them offer an extra service </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
    <p> <strong>METHODS OF ANALYSIS:</strong><br/>
      <ul class='b'>
        <li> FEATURES INVENTORY<br/>
      The intent is not only to compare the functionality of competitors website
      but also the elements visible at the 1st level of the navbar and make a quick comparison.<br/>
      <strong>Purpose:</strong> establish which categories and functions to give priority to and to
      identify how others brands organized the category groups.</li>
<br/>
      <li> TASK ANALYSIS<br/>
        To understand how to design the purchase flow, I identified the user flows that the user makes in
competitor websites to achieve its goal.<br/>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> understand every step the user takes
and the critical decision points.</li>
</ul></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong><br/>
  <br/>
  BaliYoga checkout is fluid and requires a few clicks for the expert user, but <strong>the cards</strong> (@home, marghera 43, etc.)
  <strong>can be tricky for the inexpert user because during the checkout they risk distracting or confusing him or
    worse to get the user out of the process.</strong>
  All the examined companies use the Mindbody CRM so the flow is identical, what changes is just the name of the CTAs.
  Anyway the checkout allows the user to easily change the order (number of items / cancel / continue shopping).

<h2>Hypothesis to validate</h2>
<p>I assume that <b>the current structure of the individual courses may cause the user to leave the website</b> because:
being the important information fragmented in various pages is not clear to understand how they work. <br/>
The request for a free trial takes more than 8 clicks, the pricing page does not offer an overview of the types of packages
available and requires excessive scrolling, especially from mobile.
The checkout process is tricky for the less experienced user.</p>

   <h1>User Research</h1>

   <p>The company has got an audience of various age groups, <strong>approximately between 20 and 65 years old</strong>,
     who practice yoga to combat stress, keep fit in a healthy way, restore mind and spirit.
The age target was defined based on the followers and posts published on the company Instagram profile.</p>

    <p>
      <br/>
    I surveyed 70 people aged 18-60 who take or have taken fitness &#47; yoga lessons at the gym in the past.
       With the collected data I then defined 4 Personas.

   <h1>14 Opportunities</h1>
  <h2>Surfaced by Analysis and User Journeys</h2>
   <p>
     <br/>
     <ol>
       <li> <strong> From the homepage are not immediately clear all the services offered. &#8594; </strong>
         Add a homepage section for each service, giving more emphasis to individual courses
         (possibility to reach a wider audience than training and company courses).</li><br/>
         <li><strong> "Book Trial Lesson" has too many buttons and the user flow is confusing and interrupted.&#8594; </strong>
         Reduce clicks and make flow more linear.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> The "Calendar" could be improved. &#8594; </strong>
   Optimize the Calendar view and implement filters.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> The "Princing" page does not provide an immediate overview of all packages available. &#8594; </strong>
   Improve package organization to facilitate an overview at a glance.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> The "Lessons" page has many CTAs: links and buttons. &#8594; </strong>
   Determine which flow to prioritize and make other CTAs secondary or alternatively see to merge some pages.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "@Home" has got 6 primary buttons. &#8594; </strong>
     Reduce the path "Book Trial Lesson" to 1 button and delete one of the two flows for "Buy" because
     they lead to the same result.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> The app download is inside a section. &#8594; </strong>
   Provide a link or icon in the footer as well.</li><br/>
 </ol>
 </div>

 <div class='col'>

   <ol start='8'>
    <li> <strong> Where we are (it is called "Studios") is in Who We Are. &#8594; </strong>
   Optionally leave it as a sub-category in the menu, but give evidence in the footer via icon.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "Yoga Styles" is inside Who We Are. &#8594; </strong>
   Group pages more intuitively for the user.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "Yoga Styles" has no CTAs. &#8594; </strong>
   Link it to "Calendar" or "Pricing" or alternatively turn it into a section of another page.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "Checkout" has a different graphic interface. &#8594; </strong>
   Standardize the UI.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "Checkout" has various clickable cards that risk interrupting the purchase process. &#8594; </strong>
   Delete the cards because they concern the scheduled lessons so it is more useful to leave them only in Calendar.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "Registration" form is way too long. &#8594; </strong>
     Review the required fields and make the full Regulation available by click.</li><br/>
   <li> <strong> "Payment Methods" offer few options. &#8594; </strong>
  Add fast payment and other options too.</li><br/>

  <h1>Logo Redesign </h1>
  <p>I kept the flower of the original logo that becomes a lotus of 7 petals with a circle representing
           the chakras at the top.<br/>
           The "Thasadith - Bold" font takes up the elongated shapes of the petal:</p>

   <br/>
   <p>The current logo is orange, a color widely used in the food environment; the new colors are the result
   of a survey submitted to a group of users:<br/>
   <b>INDIGO</b> - 6th Chakra (third eye chakra)<br/>
   Symbol of spirituality and inner awakening; it represents the relationship with our inner capacities.<br/>
   <b>GREEN</b> - 4th Chackra (heart chakra)<br/>
   The color of harmony and nature: it symbolizes balance, peace and renewal.</p>

    <h1>Usability test</h1>
    <p>For this project I haven't run a real test, I just assumed to conduct 3 tests with various tasks on the main aspects of the interfaces
      to determine the level of usability. <br/>
      The testers would be the customers and/or followers of the brand,
      contacted by email or post on its social channels with the following invitation:</p>
      <p><em>"We are making changes to our website baliyoga.it to improve the services we offer,
        to make browsing easier and the experience of people who use it more enjoyable.<br/>
        To do this WE NEED YOUR HELP.<br/>
        We would like to learn from your feedback or suggestions that will be valuable in improving our services.<br/>
        For this reason we invite you to take part in a test that will last about 20 minutes in which we will ask you
        to carry out some actions within the website.<br/>
        We are going to test pages not people so don't hesitate!"</em></p>
      <br/>
        <p>The user can choose whether to stop at the first test or complete all 3.<br/>
One of the following benefits would be offered to thank testers for their contribution and time spent:<br/>
<ul>
  <li> discount on a lesson package </li>
<li> branded gadget (economy range) </li>
<li> access to exclusive video content. </li>
</ul>
 </p>
</div>

<div class='col'>
  <p><b>Criteria</b><br/>
 <ul class='b'>
 <li> In-person, unmoderated</li>
 <li> Time assigned</li>
 <li> Target of 5 people (female and male) with medium&#47;high devices proficiency
   (because online booking is always requested)</li>
 </ul>
    <br/>

<h2>
TEST 1 <span class="dash"> Desktop, Mobile &amp; App Interface </span>
</h2>
<br/>
<p><b>Method: Scripted, unmoderated test.</b><br/>
</p><br/>
<p> It is about 3 task scenarios that cover all the flow the user need to join an individual yoga course. <br/>
<br/>
<b>TASK SCENARIO A</b><br/>
  "You have never done yoga but you are interested in practicing it.
  You have been recommended the Bali Yoga center which offers 1 free trial lesson.
<br/>
You are on the homepage of the website and would like to request a free trial lesson.
Where would you click?"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Goals A</b><br/>
  Understanding if the user who interacts with the website for the first time immediately learns that he can get a free lesson.
  </p>
  <br/>
<br/>
</div>

<div class='col'>
  <p><b>TASK SCENARIO B</b><br/>
  You are willing to do yoga from home through online lessons, so you would like to buy a package just dedicated
   to interactive classes.<br/>
You want to buy "5 Lessons" to be made exclusively from home. Where would you go to purchase this package?
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Goals B</b><br/>
  It is possible to proceed in various ways, by: <br/>
<ul>
  <li> Button on the header  </li>
  <li> Menu &gt; Lessons</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The aim is to understand if the splitting of gym &#47; interactive lessons packages is clear enough
  and if the user quickly understands that some packages are mixed.
  </p>
</div>

<div class='col1'>
  <p><b>TASK SCENARIO C</b><br/>
  You already have a subscription to yoga courses and you just want to book
  your next lesson on the website's Calendar, because you know that booking is mandatory for each lesson before taking it.
  <br/>

You would like to book the evening lesson on Friday, March 16th held by teacher Fabrizio. What page would you go on?</p>
<br/>

<b>Goals C</b><br/>
It is possible to complete the task by:<br/>
<ul>
  <li> Menu &gt; Book Calendar</li>
  <li> CTA on page <em>Lessons</em></li>

</ul>
</p>
  <p>Understand if the booking flow is fluid.  </p>
</div>

<hr class="horizontal">


    <div class='col1'>
<h2>TEST 2 <span class="dash"> Desktop &amp; Mobile Interface </span>
</h2>
<br/>
<p><b>Method: 5 second test.</b><br/>
<br/>

<p><em>Lessons</em> page is shown and the user is asked to memorize as many elements as possible within 5 seconds.
 When the time is up, some questions are asked.
</p><br/>

<p><b>QUESTIONS </b><br/>
<ul>
  <li> What is the service offered in the page you saw?</li>
  <li> What can you do through this page?</li>
  <li> What happens if you click the blue button?</li>
  <li> Does this page give you any information on interactive lessons?</li>
</ul>
</p><br/>

<p><b>Goals </b><br/>

Find out if:<br/>
<ul>
  <li> UI communicates the message correctly</li>
  <li> Contents are immediately clear</li>
  <li> CTAs are perceived correctly</li>
</ul>

<h5 class='green'>HOW MISTAKES DURING THE USER RESEARCH TAKE DESIGN IN OTHER DIRECTIONS</h5>
<p>It was not possible to ask the target to navigate the current website, this constraint probably
  made the design solutions turn in another direction because I asked generic questions.
Despite this, I got some useful inputs.</p>
</div>

<div class="column-twin">
<h5 class='green'>IS THE APP REALLY USEFUL?</h5>
<p>Not really,
  because it does not offer added value.<br/>
  It is just a login where the user can purchase and monitor his cards and booking calendar.
In the redesign, I added the login in the header of all interfaces, so the user can check his activity from there,
making the app unnecessary also because it does not offer extra features.
For the purposes of the project, I took it into consideration because it currently exists.
